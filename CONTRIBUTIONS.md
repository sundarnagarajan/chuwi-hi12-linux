Contributions are welcome and appreciated.

Guidelines:
- Read [LICENSE](https://github.com/sundarnagarajan/rdp-xl200c-linux/blob/master/LICENSE) to understand the LICENSE used for this project - your contributions when accepted will also be licensed under these terms
- If you want to license your contribution under a **different** license, you need to do the following:
      - Choose one of the [Open Source Licenses supported on github](https://help.github.com/articles/licensing-a-repository/)
      - Include in your pull request the **reason** why you need a different license
      - Work with me on figuring out whether your contribution can be licensed under a different license. Most of the time it may be possible. However, if your contribution is going to be part of a larger whole within this repository, or if your contribution uses other parts of this repository already licensed under the terms in [LICENSE](https://github.com/sundarnagarajan/rdp-xl200c-linux/blob/master/LICENSE), it may be difficult or impossible to license your contribution under a different license
- Submit a pull request - see [this guide on github](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)

Thanks for your contributions!
