## Non-commercial
I provide links to examples of [laptops / notebooks / tablets / mini PC etc running on the Intel Cherry Trail (TM) platform](/cherry_trail_products.md) only to help other users of these products identify their products and know that the products they own (probaby) use this platform. This is **NOT a buying guide or a recommendation site**.

I also provide links to [accessories that are known to be Linux-compatible](/linux_compatible_accessories.md). This is  only to help other users easily find accessories that will work well under Linux.

I have no commercial affiliation whatsoever with the manufacturers of these products or the retail web sites listed.

I receive no commission, fees, or other fungible benefits from any of the manufacturers or retail web sites listed here.

I will gladly accept links to other products that run on the Intel Cherry Trail (TM) platform or useful accessories that are known to be tested under Linux provided the following conditions are met:
* The links should be submitted as a pull request on this github repository
* The Links should not contain any tracking components in the URLs
* The links should not include any sales affiliation components that allows anyone to derive sales commissions, fees or other recognitions
* The pull request should clearly state the above

If a link is subsequently found to violate the above conditions, **I reserve the right to edit the URL and / or remove the links completely**.

I am not at all against commercial affiliations / sales commissions / fees or other types of recognitions. This repository and this file is just not the place for them.

## Request for removal
If you are the owner of one of the sites listed, and you do not want a particular URL listed, open an issue indicating:
* Which specific URL you want removed
* Reason for removal
* Proof that you own the URL

I will be happy to remove URLs for any issues opened with valid information as indicated above.

## No recommendations
I do not specifically recommend any of the products listed below. I also do not specifically express any preferences of one product over another except for:
* If I have found a model to have specific issues or had issues relating to a model reported on this github repository, I may make a reference to such issues, and may also list known solutions / workarounds if available - **primary purpose of this repository**
* If I have not found any issues myself or had issues reported on this github repository related to a model, I may indicate as such
* If I have personally tested a model, I may indicate as such

## No preference for retail web sites
In general I do not have a preference for product links on any particular retail web site over another. If the same product is listed on multiple web sites, I would **prefer** links to a web site that have a history of keeping links available even when the product in question is no longer being sold by them. Amazon is **one example** of such a retail web site.

Links to manucacturer URLs are also welcome (even preferred).
