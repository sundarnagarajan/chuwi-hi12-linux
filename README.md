# chuwi-hi12-linux
Linux on the Chuwi Hi12 12-inch convertible laptop

## Where have we reached?

The device can boot Linux from the pre-created remastered Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 ISO on my  [rdp-thinbook-linux](https://github.com/sundarnagarajan/rdp-thinbook-linux) repository

### Open issues
- Accelerometer senses the position wrong and the screen appears upside down when using it in landscape mode. Sensing is correct in portrait mode
- Audio out **only** on headphones, not speakers. This model uses the ES8316 driver
