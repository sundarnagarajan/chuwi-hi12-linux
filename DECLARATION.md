## Reporting trademark issues
Please open an issue on this github repository. If possible, label your issue as ```trademark```. The label is already created and ready. Include the following information:
* Which trademark is affected?
* Who is the trademark owner?
* Which file is affected - full path?
* What information do you want removed / changed in the file?
* Are you the owner of the related trademark?

I will make the required changes as soon as possible.
Note: you do **NOT** have to be the owner of the trademark to open this kind of issue. If you simply notice the issue and / or you are more knowledgeable than I am about what needs to be changed, I will be happy to review your suggestion.
